revision 0.1 define input port

note 1: port selection

As the SPI-interface will not be used for this project the ports PA4..PA7 are free for testing

note 2: LED1 Green

Connected to BlinkPlug pin DIO
Connected to STM32F1xx pin PA4 as input

To avoid short circuits, the input pin must be configured with pull-up

input: CNF = %10, MODE = %00
pull-up: GPIOA.ODR set bit 4 (ODR4)


note 3: LED2 Red (NOT YET CONNECTED)

Connected to BlinkPlug pin AIO
Connected to STM32F1xx pin PA5 as output.

To avoid short circuits, the ouput pin must be configured as 0-level output, but never as 1-level output.
 
revision 0.2 define interrupt on input port

note 4: design notes

Interrupt on PA4, so settings to be for EXTI4 ( irq-exti4)
This is interrupt EXTI4 on positions 10 ( re. Table63 ) of the STM32F1 manual
